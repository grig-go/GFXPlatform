# Virtual Set

The Virtual Set page allows you to design and control virtual environments powered by AI and Unreal Engine.

## Overview

The Virtual Set feature includes:
- AI-powered background generation
- Real-time Unreal Engine integration
- Element configuration (floors, walls, platforms)
- Actor positioning
- Lighting and screen controls

## AI Image Generation

Generate custom backgrounds using AI:

1. Enter a descriptive **prompt** for your desired environment
   - Example: "Modern news studio with blue lighting and glass walls"
2. Click **Generate** to create AI images
3. Review generated options
4. Select an image to use as your background
5. Fine-tune with additional prompts if needed

### Tips for Better Prompts

- Be specific about lighting ("soft blue ambient lighting")
- Describe materials ("polished concrete floor")
- Include style references ("minimalist modern design")
- Mention camera angle if relevant ("wide angle view")

## Configuring Set Elements

Customize your virtual set components:

| Element | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Floor** | Material, color, reflectivity |
| **Walls** | Texture, transparency, color |
| **Platforms** | Position, size, material |
| **Screens** | Content source, position, size |
| **Lighting** | Color, intensity, direction |

## Connecting to Unreal Engine

1. Select the target **Unreal Engine channel**
2. Click **Connect** to establish the connection
3. Use **Send to Unreal** to push changes
4. Enable **Live Update** for real-time sync
5. Use **Preview** to see changes before broadcasting

## AI Settings

Configure AI generation settings:

- **Gemini API Key** - Google AI API key for text generation
- **Imagen Model** - Image generation model selection
- **Prompt Enhancement** - Default prompt additions for quality
- **Storage Bucket** - Where to save generated images
